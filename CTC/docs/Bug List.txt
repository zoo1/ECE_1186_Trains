Bugs:

Summary: Next destination was not being reset on update
System Configuration: Justin's computer, Java 1.8
Steps to reproduce: use MessageTester to send train location messages to the CTC Server
Expected behavior: next destination should be set to the next destination or "None" if a train arrives at a location.
Actual behavior: next destination remains the same.
Fixed in: d48801c; CTC Server 3.2

Summary: time modifier was able to have a value of zero.  This is bad for the train model, and I was requested to change this.
System Configuration: Justin's computer, Java 1.8
Steps to reproduce: press the pause button next to "current time," or change the time modifier to 0.
Expected behavior: time modifier should be set to a very small value instead of zero to avoid problems in the train model.
Actual behavior: the value was changed to zero.
Fixed in: 2ad2f76; Time Modifier

Summary: suggested speed and authority were sent as messages to the track controller even when a train was not yet created or the schedule was not yet active.
System Configuration: Justin's computer, Java 1.8
Steps to reproduce: update the suggested speed or authority before executing a schedule.
Expected behavior: no updates to the track controller should be sent before schedule execution starts
Actual behavior: suggested speed and authority are sent regardless of the schedule exeucting.

Summary: suggested speed remained the same value even after authority was zero.
System Configuration: Justin's computer, Java 1.8
Steps to reproduce: use MessageTester to send location messages to the CTC server until the authority becomes zero.

Actual behavior: suggested speed retains its value even after the authority decreases to zero.
